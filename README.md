## About files
- ✨[settings_glob] i✨s a global vs code settings' file, we need to copy content from this file to settings.json file in your vs code app.
- ✨[settings_add] ✨is a local settings' file for your Django project. We need to create folder in your Django project and give it this name - .vscode. Then we need to create settings.json file and add content from settings_add.
- ✨launch_django ✨is a settings' debug file for your Django project. In our Django project folder - .vscode  we need to create launch.json file and add content from launch_django.
- ✨.pylintrc ✨is a linter file. We need to copy it to the root folder of your project near manage.py, .vscode folder etc.
- ✨extensions ✨- this is a picture file with extensions that we need in our Django projects

## Features

If we just copy files we need to change names in our settings files to launch.json, settings.json
